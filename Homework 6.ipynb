    "- `\\text{ }` is for displaying the enclosed string as plain text, without the mathematical rendering.\n",
    "- `&` is for alignment. The convention is right align before the first `&`, then left align between the first and second `&` of each line, then right align again between the second and third `&` and so on. Hence, to make it right aligned both before and after the colon, we use a double `&&` after the `\\text{}`. If this is confusing, you can simply copy this convention for this homework (`&&` after the explanation of constraint, and `&` before the sign). \n",

    "When formulating the linear program in part a), **instead of manually defining each variable as in the hint in the book, you should practice using indexing notation**, which also saves you effort on manual input and makes your formulation easily generalizable to larger data sets.

    "- $I=\\{A,B,C\\}$ represents the set of plants;\n",
    "- $J=\\{O,T,H,D\\}$ represent the set of manufacturers. \n",

(For example $x_{AO}$ is the amount shipped from Arlington to Onyx. $\\sum_{j\\in J} x_{Aj}$ is the total amount produced from Arlington. $\\sum_{i \\in I} x_{iO}$ is the total amount shipped to Onyx.)\n",

    "- For each manufactuer $j \\in J$, the demand of motors per month is given by $d_j$. (For example, $d_O=300$, $d_T=500$.) \n",
    "- For each plant $i\\in I$ and each manufacturer $j\\in J$, the transportation cost from plant $i$ to manufactuer $j$ can be indexed by $c_{ij}$. (For example using the data from the table associated with the question, $c_{AO}=3$, $c_{BT}=4$.)\n",
    "\n",
    "To write a indexed variable in Latex, you can use `c_{ij}` for $c_{ij}$ (make sure to enclose it either in single dollar sign for in-line math or double-dollar sign for stand-alone math). To write summation, you can use the command `\\sum`, with underline and braces to indicate the set you are summing over. For example (double click the following expression to see the code), \n",
