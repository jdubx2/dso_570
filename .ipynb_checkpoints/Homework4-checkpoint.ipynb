    "You must use Jupyter notebook to complete homework 2 and submit it as a .ipynb file on Blackboard. This is to have you practice writing notebooks using markdown and code. For a tutorial on markdown, see: https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet. If you use code to solve for the final answer, please give your answer as part of a print statement that explains what the number means. Example: `print('Probability that X=5 is', prob)`. See these tutorials for how to nicely format output: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-string-formatters-in-python-3 and https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/string/format.\n"

Illustrate each application using reasonable parameters you choose, and plot the PMF or PDF of the distribution as well as a histogram of 100 samples. Write one sentence to summarize an insight from looking at the histogram or the PMF/PDF that may be helpful for the application you chose."
